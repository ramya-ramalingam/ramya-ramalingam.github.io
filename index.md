## About Me

My name is Ramya, and I’m majoring in mathematics and computer science at Harvey Mudd College. I’ve just completed my junior year. My current research interests are theoretical machine learning and AI, but I also love exploring other topics in math and CS. This summer, the research I’m doing is in the area of robotics, and I’m enjoying it immensely and learning a lot! Other interests of mine include reading fiction, writing and playing badminton. I also learn Indian classical music and western classical piano, and spend a lot of my free time doing those. A couple of my favorite books are “The Rook” by Daniel O’Malley and “The Likeness” by Tana French.
